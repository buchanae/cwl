This is a Go library and command line tool for working with the [common workflow language (CWL)](http://commonwl.org). 

The core library includes the data type
present in the CWL spec (CommandLineTool, Workflow, etc.), with a few extra utilities for loading and working with CWL documents. 

For details, see the [reference docs](https://godoc.org/github.com/buchanae/cwl).

## Subpackages

The [process](./process) library contains experimental, unfinished code for processing CWL documents in order to execute commands and workflows.

The [expr](./expr) library contains utilities for parsing CWL expressions out of strings. This parser is not yet robust (see the known issues below).

## Alpha quality

At the time of this writing, this library is only a couple weeks old. I feel that the core CWL document loading library is fairly stable, but I can't promise that there aren't plenty of bugs lurking. 

The command line tool is far from stable, and needs work before becoming useful.

The [process](./process) library is highly experimental. Processing CWL tools and workflows in a robust manner is not a trivial task.

## CLI

The `cwl` command line tool includes a few commands for loading, inspecting, and experimental support for running commands. See the [releases](https://github.com/buchanae/cwl/releases) page to download the command line tool binary.

## Usage (CLI)

The command line tool is still young and therefore fairly useless. Still:
```
cwl dump https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buchanae/cwl/master/examples/array-inputs.cwl
// ...outputs the normalized document in JSON.
```

`cwl run` exists and is experimental. This command will run a CWL document, similar `cwltool`.

## Usage (library)

```go
package main

import (
  "log"
  "github.com/buchanae/cwl"
)

func main() {
  // Load a CWL CommandLineTool document.
  path := "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buchanae/cwl/master/examples/array-inputs.cwl"
  doc, err := cwl.Load(path)
  if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
  }
  
  tool := doc.(*cwl.Tool)
  
  // Print the ID of all the input fields
  for _, input := range tool.Inputs {
    log.Println(input.ID)
  }
}
```

```
go run main.go

2018/03/12 18:16:22 filesB
2018/03/12 18:16:22 filesC
```

## Normalization

The CWL spec allows multiple different types for some fields, e.g. `CommandLineTool.inputs` may be a string, a list of strings, a map of string to string, a map of string to object, and so on. This is rather difficult to program against, especially in a statically typed language without generics or union types (i.e. Go).

This library normalizes all fields to a single type, often prefering a list where a string and map might be allowed. In the example above, [`CommandLineTool.inputs`](https://godoc.org/github.com/buchanae/cwl#Tool) is a list.

Similarly, many fields might be a [CWL expression](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/CommandLineTool.html#Expressions). In this library, any field which *might* be an expression has the type [`Expression`](https://godoc.org/github.com/buchanae/cwl#Expression).

## Notable changes and known issues

I've taken some liberties with the CWL spec:

- `CommandLineTool` is named `Tool` instead, for brevity.
- [Schema Salad](http://www.commonwl.org/v1.0/SchemaSalad.html) is not implemented and likely won't be implemented.
- `$include` and `$import` statements are not yet implemented, but will be.
- The CWL expression parser is not robust and will not correctly parse complex expressions, especially those containing `$()` and escaping.
- documentation and examples are still sparse, more on the way soon.
